# AN.PDF

This repository contains my academic and professional resumes. Previous versions of my CVs are archived in the `files/` directory, while the LaTeX source code is located in the `latex/` directory.

To build the latest version of a CV in PDF format, use the following commands:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm latex
```

The generated PDF will be available in the `output/` directory.

**Note:** Please do not copy these templates directly. Personalize and modify them as needed. My previous records are not publicly available.
